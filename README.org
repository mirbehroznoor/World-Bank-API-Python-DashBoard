#+title: World Bank API Python DashBoard
#+author: Mir Behroz Noor

*[[https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD][The World Bank Data]] has stopped visualizing data for years before 2000. This project aims at providing the visualizations of all data available from [[https://github.com/tgherzog/wbgapi][World Bank Python API]]. For me, possible Viz DashBoards were either in R and Python, both supports interactive Plotly. However, I found Python version easier to implement.*

*** _Dash App Versions_
**** _Simple App_
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirbehroznoor/World-Bank-API-Python-DashBoard/main/simpleApp.png
It is one variable app where user can only change y-axis variable. It accepts only one variable while it is possible to add as many economies as possible.
**** _Multi App_
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mirbehroznoor/World-Bank-API-Python-DashBoard/main/multiApp.png]]
The Multi App is similar with respect to number of countries. The user can change the x-axis and y-axis variables. In Multi App, the user can look for multi-variable trends for a country otherwise, multi and simple Apps are almost the same.
***** _Limitation_
The Multi App will not work if 2 or more than two economies and both indicators are selected. The problem occurs because Plotly does not support Pandas multi-index Dataframe.
+ *Better, either to select one economy with multiple indicators or one indicator with multiple economies.*

**** _Possibility to Switch_
It is possible to switch from Simple to Multi App or vice versa.
***** _Limitation_
If App was switched, the options will reset to default. The default settings can be changed from within scripts.
*** _Create a Conda Environment_
#+begin_src shell
  bash build_env.sh
#+end_src

*** _Run Python App_
Simply the run the =app.py= script.
**** _Manually_
#+begin_src bash
  cd ~/path/to/World-Bank-API-Python-DashBoard
  conda activate wbconda
  python app.py
#+end_src
The App will open in the default browser after few seconds.
**** _Automate_
***** _Write Bash Alias function_
Find or create =.bash_aliases= in folder =$HOME= Directory. Insert the function snippet:
#+begin_src bash
  wbapp() {
      cd ~/path/to/World-Bank-API-Python-DashBoard
      conda activate wbconda
      python app.py
      conda deactivate wbconda
  }
#+end_src
For shell to re-read the =.bash_aliases= file, run the following command:
#+begin_src bash
  source .bashrc
#+end_src
Afterwards in Terminal, simply run:
#+begin_src bash
  wbapp
#+end_src
