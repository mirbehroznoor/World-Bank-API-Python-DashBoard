Install minicoda3 Python version 3.9
(https:///docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
During Miniconda3 installation tick:
1. Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable
2. Register Miniconda3 as my default Python 3.9
Note Miniconda3 installation path.


Install git for windows (with default options) (https://gitforwindows.org/)

Download World Bank API files
Extract Files

Open Git Bash
Add conda.sh Path in Git Bash
Enter:
. C:/Users/your-username/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh (Type in Git Bash)


Manually open extracted path in Git Bash:
cd ~ /path/to/World-Bank-API-Python-Dashboard

Enter in Git Bash:
bash build_env.sh (Creates Conda Environment)
conda activate wbconda (Activates conda Environment)
python app.py (Runs Application)

To visit the localhost on your favorite browser.

Visit:
localhost:8050
OR
http://127.0.0.1:8050

To exit Git Bash server press:
Ctrl + C

To close Git Bash Enter:
exit

To Re-run after initial installation (for later use or once Git Bash is closed):
Open Git Bash
Manually navigate to extracted files path
Enter:
. C:/Users/your-username/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate wbconda
Python app.py


Localhost should open in default browser however a popup is shown in Windows stating "You'll need a new app to open this localhost".

Suggestion:
Amend your code as below to automatically open localhost in default browser for Windows and Linux (Ubuntu):

def open_browser():
	webbrowser.open_new('http://localhost:8050')
	#webbrowser.open_new('http://127.0.0.1:8050')This works as well


For Linux add this in instructions (Because I had to find this on my own):
Download Miniconda3
Install Miniconda3 via terminal
Close and re-open terminal
